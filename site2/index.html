<p>While Dreamcatchers continue to be used in a traditional manner in their communities and cultures of origin, a derivative form of "dreamcatchers" were also adopted into the Pan-Indian Movement of the 1960s and 1970s as a symbol of unity among the various Native American cultures, or a general symbol of identification with Native American or First Nations cultures.[4]

The name "dream catcher" was published in mainstream, non-Native media in the 1970s[6] and became widely known as a "Native crafts item" by the 1980s,[7] by the early 1990s "one of the most popular and marketable" ones.[8]

In the course of becoming popular outside the Ojibwe Nation, and then outside the pan-Indian communities, various types of "dreamcatchers", many of which bear little resemblance to traditional styles, and that incorporate materials that would not be traditionally used, are now made, exhibited, and sold by New age groups and individuals. While some people see this popularization as harmless, many Native Americans have come to see these imitation "dreamcatchers" as over-commercialized, offensively misappropriated and misused by non-Natives.[4]

A mounted and framed dreamcatcher is being used as a shared symbol of hope and healing by the Little Thunderbirds Drum and Dance Troupe from the Red Lake Indian Reservation in Minnesota. </p>
